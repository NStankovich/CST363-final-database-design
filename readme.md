## Overview

> This repository contains my final project for CST 336: Intro to Database systems. This project occured in two phases:

### _Phase 1_

> Using MySQL, we designed and implemented a relational database containing 5 tables in 3NF. Our goal was to produce a system that a healthcare organization could use to track its patients, doctors, supplies, pharmaceuticals, pharmacies and contracts. As part of this project, we designed both a technical ER diagram (to be used for support and implementation) and a non-technical ER diagram (a simpler model to be consumed by a non-technical POC).

### _Phase 2_

> In this phase, we implented a simple web interface over our database, using Java and Thymeleaf in Spring Boot. After the project's completion, I applied additional styling (which is why diagrams will differ from front-end of the hosted link).
